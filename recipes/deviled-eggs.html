    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Deviled eggs in North American English, devilled eggs in British English, also known as stuffed eggs, curried eggs, dressed eggs or angel eggs, are hard-boiled eggs that have been peeled, cut in half, with the yolk scooped out, then refilled after being mixed with other ingredients such as mayonnaise and mustard and sprinkled with paprika, cinnamon or curry powder.[1] They are generally served cold as a side dish, appetizer or a main course during gatherings or parties. The dish is popular in Europe, North America and Australia.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Cooled hard-boiled eggs are peeled and halved lengthwise, with the yolks then removed. (They can be cut crosswise for more filling). The yolk is then mashed and mixed with a variety of other ingredients.[16] These usually incorporate a fat-based product (such as butter, heavy cream, or mayonnaise) with spicy and/or piquant ingredients to contrast taste (and, sometimes, texture). One recipe has the yolks mashed with mayonnaise, dijon mustard, vinegar, pickle relish and salt and pepper.[7] The yolk mixture is then scooped into each egg "cup" formed by the firm egg whites.</p>

    <p>Ingredient choices vary widely and there is no standard recipe. Although mayonnaise is most common, some recipes use butter, and sweet pickle relish sometimes replaces the sour pickles.</p>
