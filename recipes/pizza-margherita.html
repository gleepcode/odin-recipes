    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza Margherita, also known as Margherita pizza, is, together with the pizza marinara, the typical Neapolitan pizza. It is roundish in shape with a raised edge (the cornicione) and seasoned with hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, mozzarella (buffalo mozzarella or fior di latte), fresh basil leaves, and extra virgin olive oil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The dough is made by mixing water, salt, and yeast (either sourdough, or fresh or dry baker's yeast) with flour (00 or 0).</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>The dough is stretched by the pizzaiolo ('pizza maker') in a motion going outwards from the center, pressing with the fingers of both hands on the dough ball, and flipping it several times, shaping it into a disc. It is then topped and baked in an oven, which is traditionally made of brick and wood-fired (electric or gas ovens are also used). Pizza Margherita is usually served hot on a plate or folded into four and wrapped in paper (pizza a portafoglio or a libretto).</p>
